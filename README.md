## Description

Photo Stax is free photo searching site that allows users to search over 1000s of photos from a variety of categories. This app was built utilizing the Unsplash API via the fetch method. The app is desktop and mobile friendly, thus making it responsive. 

Throughout the app, the layout of the content is mostly utilizing flexbox. Flexbox was used to align both parent and child elements for mobile, tablet, and desktop view. Flexbox is a simple way of aligning the content and placing it where it needs to be on each page.

The load more button utilizes a function to fetch more photos from the Unsplash API and an event listener on click to display the photos on the page.
